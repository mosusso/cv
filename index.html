  <h3>Profile</h3>
  <p>I am a very organized individual who uses a clear logical mind and practical approach when problem solving to see
    tasks
    through to completion and with an passion for the field of data analysis. During my previous employment and
    post-graduate studies I was exposed to a variety of statistical analyses procedures and was responsible for a range
    of
    data-centered, analytical projects. Due to the nature of my previous employment I have developed the ability to work
    under pressure, follow strict deadlines and disseminate the findings of the projects I completed to a non-technical
    audience.

    In addition to my previous studies and work experience, I feel that my ability to forge and maintain relationships
    with
    a variety of stakeholders and my willingness to learn new skills complements my practical and academic experience.
